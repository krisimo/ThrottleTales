# ThrottleTales ‚Äì Exam Project 1

## üèçÔ∏è Project Overview

ThrottleTales is a fictional motorcycle travel blog built as part of the Noroff Front-End Development 1 Exam Project. It allows users to explore and share motorcycle journeys, read travel blogs, and connect through tips and tutorials for fellow riding enthusiasts.

The goal was to create a fully responsive web app using the Noroff Blog API, supporting blog post interaction, authentication, and a dynamic user experience.

## Reflections

This project helped me tie together all the skills from the first semester ‚Äî HTML, CSS, JS, Git, and working with APIs. It challenged me to plan better, write reusable code, and think from the user‚Äôs point of view. Building a working blog platform felt like a major step forward in my journey as a developer.
